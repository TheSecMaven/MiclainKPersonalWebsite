        Small Town Living
      </div><!-- Text container -->
       <p> I grew up in a small town called Chillicothe,IL. It was just outside Peoria,IL, which you almost certainly have never heard of either. There was a total of 6000 people in this town, and in true small town fashion, it felt like I knew everybody. I played football for as long as I can remember. My dad was heavily involved in the local league (Junior Football League of Central Illinois). My dad would announce the football games (Ages 10-14) for me and everybody else that played. When I wasn't playing football, I was helping my dad my playing the music/sounds or helping out in general. We spent so many years together doing that. Very good memories. The town is situated on the west side of the Illinois River. The biggest thing that happens in this town is the Summer Camp Music Festival.Since its start in 2001, it has grown to more than 20,000 attendees. In 2014, it was listed as one of the top 40 music festivals in Rolling Stone. I spent my younger days taking the bus to Mossville Schools. I drove past the park where this is held, Three Sisters Park, every day on my way to school. In the middle of my Sophomore year in high school, my father was offered a job he had spent over 20 years of his life earning. One downside, it was exactly 500 miles due south of where we were living. We left for Memphis,TN the day after Christmas, 2012.</p>

        Y'all Don't Know The First Thing About Southern Living
      </div>
 <p>If anybody ever tells you that southern gentlemen don't exist, don't bother listening. My parents moved us to a suburb of Memphis, where southern perfection comes to life. Businesses cannot put signs on the street that are taller than 3 feet. The famous Mcdonalds "Golden Arch" stands at a measly 3 feet tall in Collierville,TN. I learned very quickly how much 500 miles can change things. I picked up right where I left off, in the middle of sophomore year. Little did I know that this school was top 10 in the state. I certainly had it in for myself. It is here I truly became disciplined, and a hard worker.  </p>
