Footnotes:
"1. Submitting a report to VAERS does not mean that healthcare personnel or the vaccine caused or contributed to the adverse"

Caveats:
"1. DISCLAIMER: VAERS staff at CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) follow up on all serious adverse event reports to"
"obtain additional medical, laboratory, and/or autopsy records to help understand the circumstances. However, VAERS public data"
"do not generally change based on the information obtained during the follow-up process. There are limitations to VAERS data. A"
"report to VAERS does not mean that the vaccine caused the adverse event, only that the adverse event occurred sometime after"
"vaccination. Read more about interpreting VAERS data: More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Additional."
"2. Some items may have more than 1 occurrence in any single event report, such as Symptoms, Vaccine Products, Manufacturers and"
"Event Categories. If data are grouped by any of these items, then the number in the Events Reported column may exceed the total"
"number of unique events. If percentages are shown, then the associated percentage of total unique event reports will exceed 100%"
"in such cases. For example, the number of Symptoms mentioned is likely to exceed the number of events reported, because many"
"reports include more than 1 Symptom. When more then 1 Symptom occurs in a single report, then the percentage of Symptoms to"
"unique events is more than 100%. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Suppress."
"3. Data contains VAERS reports processed as of 5/14/2017. The VAERS data in WONDER are updated monthly, yet the VAERS system"
"receives continuous updates including revisions and new reports for preceding time periods. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/vaers.html#Reporting."
